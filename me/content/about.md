# Hello I'm glad you are here



I am a Laravel / DevOps Solutions Developer focused on delivering production-ready applications and scalable systems.  
I work across PHP, Python, Linux, and Windows environments, handling everything from backend development to infrastructure automation.  

I build solutions that solve real problems, not just write code. My approach ensures stability, performance, and scalability in every project.
